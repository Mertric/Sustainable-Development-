  <h3 align="center">Recycle Smart</h3>
  <p align="center">
  
 This is a proof of concept application that will establish and strengthen our current understanding of the sustainability goal 12 that the United Nations have provided. 
Targeting the sub goals: 

12.5: By 2030, substantially reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse

12.8: By 2030, ensure that people everywhere have the relevant information and awareness for sustainable development and lifestyles in harmony with nature

 The lack of relevant information about recycling is not being consumed enough resulting in poor recycling habits around the world. The lack of proper of recycling habits results in overflow in landfills, increase of pollution, and destruction of natural habitats. The application I plan to develop focuses on providing the user with the relevant knowledge of recycling in a form of a mobile application. This way users can learn about recycling materials, recycling symbols and locate nearby recycling centers/disposal centers locally on the go. With the relevant knowledge and the tools provided in this application it will help establish and strengthen the userâ€™s recycling habit.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

### Impact
The application I am developing will not change our current reality but only enforce and strengthen our current understanding of the idea of sustainability in terms of properly disposing waste material. This application will target every citizen in the country who have access to a mobile device as it will provide them with information and a tool to help properly dispose of their waste material locally.

### Who (Community)
My target audience are the citizens of countries that have trouble with properly disposing waste. The opinions of everyone matters because recycling is a worldwide effort. I want my work to reach the young community as they can become educated about proper waste disposal since many of them may have access to mobile devices. With the information outputted through the mobile phones the users will have access to readily available information. With the constraints of mobile data and or WIFI access.

North star customer: Students (Elementary to post-secondary). This is because forming a good recycling habit will help in the long term of disposing waste material correctly.

Carry over customers: Parents/Teachers: Everyone is responsible for recycling their own recyclable materials, parents or teachers can help their children/students form a good recycling habit while strengthening their own recycling habit.

### What 
The constraints for this project are:

Scanning the recyclable symbol if the waste material is translucent thus the camera will not be able to detect it.

Giving access to information without any cellular data and or internet connection.

The inability to allow people who do not have access to a mobile device receive any information.

The time to develop this application is around ~2 to 3 months.
